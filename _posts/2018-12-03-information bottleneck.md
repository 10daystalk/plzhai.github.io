### What is Information Bottleneck?
Information Bottleneck is a good measure to evaluate the represenation extarcted by machine leaning algorithms in supervised tasks,which is proposed by *Tishby* in 1999.In machine learning tasks,we want to extract a representation that save the information of input data as much as possible while
eliminate the redundant information in the same time.The idea can be writen as in the following:

where MI is mutual information of the variables and $\beta$ is the tradeoff parameter used to balance of the information saved by representation T.
