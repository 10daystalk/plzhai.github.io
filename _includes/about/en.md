> Live  Read  Discover

I believe that meaningful life is nothing more than three things: life, reading, and discovery.

For a long time, I will share some of my experiences and notes about reading and learning here. On the one hand, it is for the organization of my own knowledge, on the other hand, I also hope that it is helpful for the people with similar interests. I mainly write  about the following two aspects:

First, I graduated from the Department of Mathematics and now works as a number of algorithms for statistics and data science. So I will send some meaningful articles recently read, including my implementation code, and my understanding of the data science and the future.

In addition, I am very interested in the study of social sciences. I also read some social science books. Therefore, when I am free, I will put some reading experience that I have summarized after I have studied.

The upcoming 2019, I hope to progress with you.
